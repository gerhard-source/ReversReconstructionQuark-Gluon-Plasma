# ReversReconstructionQuark-Gluon-Plasma
We present a novel reverse reconstruction method that predicts the QCD critical point at $T = 151$ MeV, $\mu_B = 364$ MeV from fundamental physical constants. Our approach shows excellent agreement with LHC data and provides testable predictions for CERN's recent oxygen-proton collision program.
